# Mod-3-PasswordGenerator

## Description

The starter code included a page that was created for a password generator.  This application was written in Javascript to gather the password criteria from the user from a series of prompts.  Each prompt is validated to ensure correct data is being entered based on the question asked.  Once all prompts are completed, a random password meeting the criteria entered is generated and shown to the user.
